# The-MotherProxy


The MotherProxy is an unblocker like all others, but we are special.

Unlike other proxies, our proxy is file based, meaning it is invisible to all administration applications, some of which include Securly, and Goguardian.
Most School administration platforms are extension based, meaning they can't see files even if they are launched in a browser.
This tool uses and HTML file embeding Doge Unblocker with Iframe to make what the public knows as The MotherProxy.
