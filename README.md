# The-MotherProxy


The MotherProxy is an unblocker like all others, but we are special.

Unlike other proxies, our proxy is file based, meaning it is invisible to all administration applications, some of which include Securly, and Goguardian.
Most School administration platforms are extension based, meaning they can't see files even if they are launched in a browser.
This tool uses and HTML file embeding Doge Unblocker with Iframe to make what the public knows as The MotherProxy.

# Usage

To use this product, open the attached HTML file which will lead you to Doge Unblocker, Then, you can type in the search bar similar to how someone would with google, or you can directly type a url to go to a website. In the top right you can find categorys for quickly accesing games or sources, along with customize some things about Doge.

# Demo

If you wish to use the demo, go to the attached google site, while it isn't invisible(because the site isnt directly a file) it is likely to not by blocked because it is on google.com. This dosen't mean that the demo is untouchable it just means that unless anyone in your supervised group has used it and gotten it blocked, it won't already be.
